This is a typing game where the more you type the more points you get. If you type a paragraph correctly, you gain points. If you don't type a paragraph correctly, you lose points.

How to test:
- Open Python (if you have installed it). If you have not, I suggest installing it.
- Click on 'File' then 'New'.
- Copy and paste the file in this repository.
- Click on 'Run' then 'Run Module'.
- Save the program.
- Enjoy!
